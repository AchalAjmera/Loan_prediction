# Loan_prediction
In this project, you will complete a notebook where we will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

Following algorithms are used to build models:
k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoass

Dataset are available at:-
